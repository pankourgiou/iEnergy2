#Again here we set c = 1 and x = 1 then we have c*E*x= E this is why there was so much of a disagreement on the initial Achille's code the cex part was a labyrinth to me!! 
print("cex = E = mcmod2")
#we can set oo = 1 then we have E = oo*gamma*mcmod2 or swift = prolog = 1 then E = gamma*swift*prolog*mcmod2 so let's print it!!
print("E = oo*gamma*mcmod2")
#or/and
print(" E = gamma*swift*prolog*mcmod2")
